# python-challenge

Worked alongside a peer on this assignment due to issues running my code in VS Code and Jupyter.  The programs have been giving me issues and I'm still troubleshooting why I am unable to run code.  My peer, Sabrina, ran the code on her end during our study session so I could verify that it worked. 

I have put my pathways to the files all the way out to the desktop just to be sure it works.  If there is an issue please let me know.

I utilized our class files and ChatGPT to write my code.
